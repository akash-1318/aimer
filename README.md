1. Display time in different formate.
2. Current weather according to city.
3. Wallpaper and quote changing on every refresh.
4. You can add your main focus for today.
5. Google search.

I have not signed up for chrome dev account as it's chargable so to use this you have to download the zip of of this repo and ---> go to manage extensions ---> turn on the developer mode ---> click on load unpacked ---> select the build folder from downloaded zip file.
